# Welcome to the first of the Git Ruby Challenges. Updated on the daily.

# Smaller and less intense than the Canvas challenges, these are designed to introduce a ruby methods and get you familiar with searching for a solution

# First Challenge is to take my string and convert every "s" character to a "th" and output that to the console.

# For example,
# my_string = "I was stranded in the Mississippi River"

# Would output "I wath thtranded in the Miththiththippi River"


# Once you are able to output the correct output when running your code, try finding a way to get input from a user when they run your code. 
# Then convert that input to a new "th" replaced string


# my_string = "I was stranded in the Mississippi River"

# puts my_string.gsub!(/s/, "th")

puts "Please input a string with at least 10 words"
user_string = gets.chomp

puts user_string.gsub(/s/, "th")
